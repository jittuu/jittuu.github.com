<p>
My name is <b>Soe Moe</b> Tun Lwin. I live in Singapore. I was born in small town, Bhamo, at the northern part of Myanmar.
</p>

<p>
I am a programmer who make living with .Net platform. At night, I am also writing programs using .Net as well as rails.
</p>

<p>
I love to develop web application, and I also believe that TDD is the way we should program. That is one of the reason most of my personal applications are using <a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc">ASP.NET MVC</a> and <a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Rails</a>.
</p>

<p> I have one small opensource project, <a href="http://www.github.com/jittuu/NSupport">NSupport</a>. </p>
