title: User Experience

Every product needs good, if not great, [User Experience][ux]. When people heard about UX, they usually confuse with User Interface. Acutally, User experince is much bigger topic than User Interface - in fact, user interface is _part of_ the UX. What makes good user _experience_ in software?

First of all, people use software to solve their problem. Every components of UX should have the common goal which is **to solve user's problem**. I believe these are the major contributor to User Experience in software.

- **User Interface** : The user should know **easily** _what to do_ and _what will they get_. [Don't make them think][dont-make-me-think].
- **Workflow** : User want to solve their problem _fast_. Make the steps short. The simpler, the better.
- **System Performance** : The faster it is, the better user experience. No one want to use _slow_ system. As jeff said, [Performance is a Feature](//blog.codinghorror.com/performance-is-a-feature/).
- **System Stablility and Reliability** : How will user feel if the system crashed after he/she took 30 minutes to fill the form?
- **Uptime** : The uptime also contributes a lot to user experience. User expect your system is available 24/7. I believe that every system should have at least 99% uptime - total max downtime will be 3.65 days per year or 7.20 hours per month. It also includes _scheduled downtime_. (_Who care? When it is down, it is not available to use. It doesn't matter either scheduled or not._).
