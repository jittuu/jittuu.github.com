I hosted my blog on [github][] using [github pages][github-pages] which is powered by [jekyll][].

I chosed Github pages hosting because of the following reasons:  

  - fullcontrol over layout and css styling
  - **versioning** by storing in git
  - markdown! _I'm writing this blog post in vim_ :)
  - it is git repo afterall, so anyone can _fork_ it! Multi-authors blogging can be achieved by forking, pull request and merging.
  - git push is publish a blog post
  - it is FREE. (_did I mention it also includes custom domain?_)

I'll use [disqus][] for comments in my blog post.
