title: Cleaning my PC
---

After running very smoothly for 2 years, my PC is starting to become unstable a few days ago. Sometimes it is freezed; mouse is not working, keyboard is not working, Ctrl+Alt+Del is not working. I have no choice but to press the reset button.

But yesterday, it was happened two or three times. That gave me a feeling of "_shit! I must fix it now_". I suspect that it must be related to CPU over-heating. I checked the CPU cooler and this is what I saw.

[The CPU temperature][coretemp] is going back to normal and this is the temperature I got after I run [Prime95][] for a few **hours** to do stress testing on CPU.

As of writing this post, I haven't found any freezing issue with my PC. We do need to add **Cleaning** to the checklist in our system maintenance plan.
