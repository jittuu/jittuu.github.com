As we all know, productivity doesn't increase just by working more hours. In fact, it has negative effect after you exceed _your limit_.

So, how should we move from red to green? Simple. We need to get _more_ things done in _less_ working hours. But it is not easy to do. Thinking about productivity remind me about the [great talk][talk] by [Scott Hanselman][scott]. I watch it _again_. If you haven't watched yet, do it now. This time, I aslo took some notes as if I'm in the lecture room.

- **Effectiveness and Efficiency**. Effectiveness is doing the right things. Efficiency is doing things right. We need to do both to improve our productivity.
- **Too much information**. There are just too much information in the internet age. We are wasting so much time on twitter, facebook, news, etc. We have to _ignore_ most of those.
- **Overtime**. When we think we need to work overtime to catch up deadline/scrum goal, it is the _danger_ sign. Avoid it. It may be either we have many things to do or we are not doing things right.
- **Email rule**. CC means _FYI_. Put all CC mails in one folder and read it all in _scheduled_ time.
- **Checking email**. _Don't check_ email in the _morning_. We are using scrum, we should know what to do at our morning stand-up meeting. _Schedule_ to check your mail, e.g. check email after lunch.
- **Pomodoro**. If you don't know, go and [read about it][pomodoro]. And _use_ it. I usually target to achieve 4-6 pomodori. Yes. There is _max limit_ for me.
- **Chrome tabs**. Many chrome tabs usually means we are wasting memory and overloaded with too many information. Close what you don't need.
