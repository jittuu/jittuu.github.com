It is a tool for file transfer. Yes, you read it correctly. It is for copy/move files.

## Wait a minute! Why I should use? Windows already provides file copying.

A few days ago, I need to transfer _a lot_ of files from _different_ folders to my external hard disk. Since they are from different folders, I need to wait until copying files/folders under one folder complete and then copy another. Of course, you can copy _at the same time_ from different folders to external drive. But it makes **really** really **slow**. At that time, I wish I have one application which can **queue** the file transfer operations like most _download managers_ did. I googled and found this tool called [Teracopy][].

Even though I used it for queuing features at first, but now **best** feature for me is **speed**. Compare to Windows original file copy, it **really**, really **fast**. You can find more features at [Product info][Teracopy].

## Ok, I want to try. How to use it?

Just [download][] and install it. You don't need to do anything special. As normal file operations, <span class="key">Ctrl+C</span>, <span class="key">Ctrl+X</span> and <span class="key">Ctrl+V</span> will do the job. It replaced Windows Copy/Cut/Paste file operations (of course, you can change it back).

Hope you find this tool is useful.
