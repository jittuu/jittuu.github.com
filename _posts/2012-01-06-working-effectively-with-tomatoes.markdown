title: "Working effectively with tomatoes"
---

Tomatoes, which are actually a fruit and not a vegetable, are loaded with all kinds of health benefits for the body. They are in fact, a highly versatile health product and due to their equally versatile preparation options. Do I eat tomatoes everyday to work effectively? Though I like tomatoes, _that_ tomatoes is not the one I used for my _productivity_.

_The_ Tomatoes I want to mention is a **time management** [technique][pomodoros] called [Pomodoros][pomodoros], which means tomatoes in Italian. You can find more information about **Pomodoros** in [here][pomodoros] and [wiki][]. In the nutshell, there are five basic steps to follow:

1. decide on the task to be done
2. set the pomodoro (timer) to 25 minutes
3. work on the task until the timer rings; record with an x
4. take a short break (5 minutes)
5. every four "pomodoros" take a longer break (15â€“20 minutes)

## Why it helps me?

We, developers, used to <s>spend</s>waste a lot of time on internet (did I say facebook?) and have got to the end of the day with feeling, "Shit!! 5:30pm? Nothing is done. Never mind, I will work hard tomorrow" and we went back. After a week, we realized that we cannot make it within the deadline. Sound familiar? _(I admit that there are some projects which already passed deadline before project actually started)_

By forcing myself to focus for **25 minutes** at a time, it <s>forces</s>helps me to work _effectively_. And also, I have _nice_ feeling of accomplishment when every time I finished one pomodoro without any _interrupt_.

## Should we work the whole day with pomodoro?

Not for me. I'm targeting to complete **eight** pomodoros _per day_ which is _four_ working hours. _But it is really up to you. ;)_

## Software?

I used [Tomighty][] and there is also nice web application called [Tomatoist][].

## Try?

It works very well for me. Why don't you give it a try? :)
